# Multi-container applications with docker-compose


Here's a prebuilt docker compose file for [Immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich), a self-hosted photo and video management solution.

# Steps

Run:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Wait for it to run, then go to [localhost:2283](localhost:2283).

Have a look at the [./docker-compose.yaml](./docker-compose.yaml) file, and see how it works.
